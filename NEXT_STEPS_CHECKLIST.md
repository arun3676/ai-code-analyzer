# âœ… Next Steps Checklist

Follow these steps in order to complete the integration.

## Phase 1: Get Your Model Ready (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Model from Google Drive
- [ ] Open Google Drive in your browser
- [ ] Navigate to `MyDrive/ai-code-analyzer/`
- [ ] Find the `fine-tuned-analyst` folder
- [ ] Download the entire folder
- [ ] Extract/move it to: `C:\Users\arunk\professional\ai-code-analyzer\fine-tuned-analyst\`

**How to verify:**
```bash
dir fine-tuned-analyst
```
You should see files like:
- `adapter_config.json`
- `adapter_model.bin` (or `.safetensors`)
- Other config files

### Step 2: Install PEFT Library
- [ ] Open terminal/PowerShell in your project folder
- [ ] Run: `pip install peft`
- [ ] Wait for installation to complete

**How to verify:**
```bash
python -c "import peft; print('PEFT installed successfully')"
```

## Phase 2: Test Locally (2 minutes)

### Step 3: Run Test Script
- [ ] In terminal, run: `python test_finetuned_local.py`
- [ ] Wait for all checks to complete
- [ ] Verify all checks show âœ… (green checkmarks)

**If any checks fail:**
- Read the error message carefully
- Follow the suggested fix
- Re-run the test script

**Expected output:**
```
âœ… Found adapter folder
âœ… All required files present
âœ… Dependencies imported successfully
âœ… Tokenizer loaded
âœ… Base model loaded
âœ… Adapters loaded successfully
âœ… Model inference working correctly!
âœ… Enhanced analyzer can be imported
ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS: All checks passed!
```

## Phase 3: Integrate with UI (10 minutes)

### Step 4: Backup Your Current UI
- [ ] Copy `matrix_final.py` to `matrix_final_backup.py`

**Command:**
```bash
copy matrix_final.py matrix_final_backup.py
```

### Step 5: Update Imports
- [ ] Open `matrix_final.py` in your editor
- [ ] Find line ~8: `from optimized_code_analyzer import OptimizedCodeAnalyzer`
- [ ] Replace with: `from optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced import EnhancedCodeAnalyzer`

### Step 6: Update Analyzer Function
- [ ] Find the function `get_local_analyzer()` (around line 287)
- [ ] Replace the entire function with:
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_local_analyzer(model_type="codet5"):
    return EnhancedCodeAnalyzer(
        model_type=model_type,
        precision="fp16",
        quick_max_new_tokens=180,
        detailed_max_new_tokens=300,
    )
```

### Step 7: Add Model Selector to Sidebar
- [ ] Find the sidebar section (around line 490, look for `st.sidebar`)
- [ ] Add this code after other sidebar elements:
```python
# Model Selection
st.sidebar.markdown("---")
st.sidebar.markdown("### ðŸ¤– AI Model Selection")
model_choice = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Choose Analysis Model:",
    ["CodeT5+ (Fast)", "Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Accurate)"],
    help="CodeT5+ is faster, Fine-tuned model gives more detailed analysis"
)

model_type = "codet5" if "CodeT5+" in model_choice else "deepseek-finetuned"
```

### Step 8: Update Analyzer Calls
- [ ] Find where `local_analyzer = get_local_analyzer()` is called
- [ ] Replace with: `local_analyzer = get_local_analyzer(model_type)`
- [ ] Look for all instances (there might be 2-3 places)

**Hint:** Use Ctrl+F to find "get_local_analyzer()"

### Step 9: Update requirements.txt
- [ ] Open `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Add this line if not present: `peft>=0.7.0`
- [ ] Save the file

## Phase 4: Test Everything (5 minutes)

### Step 10: Run Streamlit App
- [ ] In terminal: `streamlit run matrix_final.py`
- [ ] Wait for app to load
- [ ] Browser should open automatically

### Step 11: Test CodeT5+ Model
- [ ] In the sidebar, select "CodeT5+ (Fast)"
- [ ] Paste a simple code snippet (or use the examples)
- [ ] Click "ðŸš€ Analyze Code"
- [ ] Verify you get analysis results
- [ ] Should take 2-3 seconds

**Example code to test:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Step 12: Test Fine-tuned DeepSeek Model
- [ ] In the sidebar, select "Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Accurate)"
- [ ] Use the same code snippet
- [ ] Click "ðŸš€ Analyze Code"
- [ ] Verify you get detailed analysis with:
  - Quality Score (e.g., "Quality Score: 85/100")
  - BUGS section
  - PERFORMANCE ISSUES section
  - SECURITY CONCERNS section
  - IMPROVEMENTS section with code examples
- [ ] Should take 3-5 seconds

### Step 13: Test Model Switching
- [ ] Switch back to "CodeT5+ (Fast)"
- [ ] Analyze different code
- [ ] Switch to "Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Accurate)"
- [ ] Analyze the same code again
- [ ] Both should work without errors

### Step 14: Test Caching
- [ ] Analyze the same code twice with the same model
- [ ] Second time should say "âš¡ Using cached result!"
- [ ] Should be instant (< 0.1 seconds)

## Phase 5: Final Verification (2 minutes)

### Step 15: Quality Check
- [ ] Fine-tuned model gives quality scores (1-100)
- [ ] Fine-tuned model provides structured output
- [ ] CodeT5+ still works as before
- [ ] No error messages in terminal or browser
- [ ] UI loads quickly
- [ ] Both models can analyze code successfully

### Step 16: Document Your Setup
- [ ] Take a screenshot of working analysis
- [ ] Note which model works better for your use cases
- [ ] Save any error messages you encountered (for future reference)

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "fine-tuned-analyst not found"**
- [ ] Check folder is in correct location
- [ ] Verify folder name spelling
- [ ] Ensure it's extracted (not still zipped)

**Issue: "PEFT not installed"**
- [ ] Run: `pip install peft`
- [ ] Restart terminal
- [ ] Try again

**Issue: "Model too slow"**
- [ ] Use CodeT5+ for faster analysis
- [ ] Reduce max_new_tokens to 150
- [ ] Close other applications

**Issue: "Out of memory"**
- [ ] Close browser tabs
- [ ] Restart Streamlit
- [ ] Use CodeT5+ (smaller model)

**Issue: "Import Error"**
- [ ] Check file names are correct
- [ ] Verify `optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced.py` exists
- [ ] Try: `python -c "from optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced import EnhancedCodeAnalyzer"`

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

1. **Check error messages** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Review INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Has detailed explanations
3. **Run test script again** - `python test_finetuned_local.py`
