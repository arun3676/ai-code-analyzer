# Integration Guide: Fine-tuned Model with Your Code Analyzer

This guide explains how to integrate your fine-tuned DeepSeek model with the existing code analyzer app.

## 📋 What You Have Now

After completing the Colab training, you have:
- ✅ Fine-tuned DeepSeek model adapters (~20MB)
- ✅ Enhanced analyzer class supporting both models
- ✅ Original CodeT5+ model still working
- ✅ All existing UI features preserved

## 🔄 Integration Steps

### Step 1: Download Your Fine-tuned Model from Colab

In your final Colab cell, you saved the model to Google Drive. Now download it:

**Option A: From Google Drive**
1. Go to Google Drive → `MyDrive/ai-code-analyzer/`
2. Download the `fine-tuned-analyst` folder
3. Place it in your project root: `C:\Users\arunk\professional\ai-code-analyzer\fine-tuned-analyst\`

**Option B: Download Directly from Colab**
```python
# Run this in Colab to create a downloadable ZIP
import shutil
shutil.make_archive('fine-tuned-analyst', 'zip', './fine-tuned-analyst')

from google.colab import files
files.download('fine-tuned-analyst.zip')
```

Then extract the ZIP in your project root.

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Update your `requirements.txt` to include PEFT:

```bash
# Add this line to requirements.txt
peft>=0.7.0
```

Install it:
```bash
pip install peft
```

### Step 3: Test the Enhanced Analyzer Locally

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced.py
```

You should see:
- ✅ CodeT5+ analysis
- ✅ Fine-tuned DeepSeek analysis
- ✅ Model comparison

### Step 4: Update Your Streamlit UI

Replace the analyzer import in `matrix_final.py`:

**Find this (around line 8):**
```python
from optimized_code_analyzer import OptimizedCodeAnalyzer
```

**Replace with:**
```python
from optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced import EnhancedCodeAnalyzer
```

**Find this (around line 287):**
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_local_analyzer():
    return OptimizedCodeAnalyzer(
        model_id="Salesforce/codet5p-220m",
        precision="fp16",
        quick_max_new_tokens=180,
        detailed_max_new_tokens=240,
    )
```

**Replace with:**
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_local_analyzer(model_type="codet5"):
    return EnhancedCodeAnalyzer(
        model_type=model_type,
        precision="fp16",
        quick_max_new_tokens=180,
        detailed_max_new_tokens=300,
    )
```

### Step 5: Add Model Selector to Sidebar

Add this to your sidebar (around line 490, in the sidebar section):

```python
# Model Selection
st.sidebar.markdown("---")
st.sidebar.markdown("### 🤖 AI Model Selection")
model_choice = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Choose Analysis Model:",
    ["CodeT5+ (Fast)", "Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Accurate)"],
    help="CodeT5+ is faster, Fine-tuned model gives more detailed analysis"
)

model_type = "codet5" if "CodeT5+" in model_choice else "deepseek-finetuned"
```

### Step 6: Update the Analysis Call

Find where the analyzer is called (around line 600+) and update it:

**Find something like:**
```python
local_analyzer = get_local_analyzer()
result = local_analyzer.analyze_code_fast(code)
```

**Replace with:**
```python
local_analyzer = get_local_analyzer(model_type)
result = local_analyzer.analyze_code_fast(code)
```

### Step 7: Test Everything

Run your Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run matrix_final.py
```

Test both models:
1. Select "CodeT5+ (Fast)" → Run analysis → Should work as before
2. Select "Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Accurate)" → Run analysis → Should give detailed analysis with quality scores

## 📊 What Each Model Does

### CodeT5+ (Base Model)
- **Speed**: ⚡ Fast (2-3 seconds)
- **Memory**: ~1GB
- **Analysis**: General code analysis
- **Best for**: Quick checks, batch processing
- **Quality**: Good for basic issues

### Fine-tuned DeepSeek (Your Model)
- **Speed**: 🚀 Moderate (3-5 seconds)
- **Memory**: ~1.5GB
- **Analysis**: Detailed with quality scores (1-100)
- **Best for**: Deep analysis, learning, production code
- **Quality**: Excellent - trained on your specific patterns
- **Output format**: 
  - Quality Score (1-100)
  - Bugs section
  - Performance issues
  - Security concerns
  - Improvement suggestions with code examples

## 🎯 Key Features of the Enhanced System

### 1. Dual Model Support
- Seamlessly switch between models
- Separate caching for each model
- No breaking changes to existing code

### 2. Improved Analysis Quality
Your fine-tuned model provides:
- **Structured output**: Quality score, bugs, performance, security
- **Code examples**: Shows how to fix issues
- **Contextual understanding**: Trained on your dataset patterns
- **Consistent formatting**: Always includes all sections

### 3. Memory Efficient
- LoRA adapters are tiny (~20MB vs 1GB+ full model)
- Base model shared, adapters loaded on demand
- Can deploy both models without doubling memory

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Deployment (Current)
**Pros:**
- Free
- Fast
- Full control
- Easy testing

**Cons:**
- Only you can use it
- Needs your computer running

**Setup:** Already working! Just use Streamlit locally.

### Option 2: Hugging Face Spaces (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- FREE hosting
- Automatic HTTPS
- Share with anyone
- GPU available (paid tier)

**Setup:**
1. Create account on huggingface.co
2. Create new Space (Streamlit)
3. Upload files:
   - `matrix_final.py`
   - `optimized_code_analyzer_enhanced.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `fine-tuned-analyst/` folder
4. Add `app.py`:
```python
# app.py (for HF Spaces)
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["streamlit", "run", "matrix_final.py"])
```

### Option 3: Railway.app
**Cost:** $5/month
**Memory:** Up to 8GB
**Speed:** Faster than HF Spaces

**Setup:**
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Set start command: `streamlit run matrix_final.py --server.port $PORT`
3. Deploy

### Option 4: Render.com
**Cost:** FREE tier available
**Memory:** 512MB (might be tight)
**Speed:** Good

**Setup:**
1. Connect repo
2. Use Docker:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD streamlit run matrix_final.py --server.port $PORT
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "fine-tuned-analyst folder not found"
**Solution:** Make sure the folder is in your project root with these files:
```
fine-tuned-analyst/
├── adapter_config.json
├── adapter_model.bin (or adapter_model.safetensors)
├── tokenizer_config.json
└── special_tokens_map.json
```

### Issue: "PEFT not installed"
**Solution:** 
```bash
pip install peft
```

### Issue: "Model too slow"
**Solution:** 
- Use "quick" mode instead of "detailed"
- Reduce `max_new_tokens` to 150
- Use INT8 or INT4 quantization

### Issue: "Out of memory"
**Solution:**
- Close other applications
- Use CodeT5+ instead (smaller)
- Enable quantization: `precision="int8"`
